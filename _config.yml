about_content: |
  Hi, my name is Jongsu Kim, I'm a upcoming PhD qualified
  by a research background in machine learning and mathematical modeling
  focused on time series forecasting and computational fluid dynamics.

  I have a strong coding ability both in producing clean and efficient code.
  Moreover, with mathematically modeling experience, I have strong analytic skills.
  I also enjoy learning and mastering new technologies.
