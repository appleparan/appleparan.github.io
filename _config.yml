about_content: |
  Hi, I'm Jongsu Kim. I'm a Ph.D. in Computational Science and Engineering-Mechanical/Electrical Engineering
  qualified by a research background in machine learning and mathematical modeling
  focused on time series forecasting and computational fluid dynamics.

  I can do mathematical or physical modeling numerically and have analytic skills for physical phenomenon.
  Not only modeling skills, I also have a strong computer science background and like to actively learn new technologies.

          * Particulate Matter (PM) forecasting by deep learning methods for time series forecasting (2018-2021)
          * Modeling and simulation of finite-size particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using psuedo-spectral methods and immersed boundary methods (2015-2018)
          * Modeling and simulation of finite-size droplets in laminar flows with gravity field using level set methods (2011-2015)
          * Communicate to support laboratory colleagues who was struggling with computer science-related problems such as algorithms, debugging, and so on.
            The process was then documented so that the next time the team encountered the same situation, they could follow a similar procedure.
          * Programming knowledge (mainly Julia, C++, Fortran)
          * Create web pages for multiple purposes in the department, such as conference, introduction pages, and so on.
          * Administrator of laboratory server (cluster with ~30 nodes)
