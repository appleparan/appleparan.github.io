Hi! My name is Jongsu Kim(김종수) in Korean, but I prefer to use English name as "Jongsu Liam Kim". 
I'm a PhD candidate of Computational Science and Engineering (a.k.a <a href="https://cse.yonsei.ac.kr/cse/index.do">CSE</a>) 
at <a href="https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp">Yonsei University</a>, South Korea. 
I'm currently working on time series forecasting with deep learning. Previously, I had studied Computational Fluid Dynamics.
I'm a <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">open source</a> enthusiast and love to contribute open-source projects.
I enjoy writing programs in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>.
Not only writing programs, I also like to explore physics and mathematics topics.
