Hi, my name is Jongsu Kim(김종수) in Korean, but I prefer to use English name as "Liam Kim". 
I'm CFD engineer studying for PhD in Computational Science and Engineering at Yonsei university, South Korea.
I have a B.S. for Atomspheric Science and Computer Science at Yonsei University.
My research interest is now predcition of mulitivariate time series using machine learning.
Not only scientific study of research, I'm also highly interested in scientific computing and HPC(High Performance Computing) field, especially writing numerical simulation code in [Julia, a programming language for numerical computing](https://julialang.org/). I'm always interested in writing GOOD scientific code. That's why I love Julia, which helps users to write high performance and well-structured code.
